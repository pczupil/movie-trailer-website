About:
    The project uses the provided "fresh_tomatoes.py" file to generate an HTML
    file that displays a grid of movie posters, along with other information
    about the movies. Clicking on a poster will bring up the movie's trailer (via
    youtube). Clicking on a movie's "storyline" button will replace the poster
    with some text briefly describing the film's storyline. The poster is
    brought back by clicking the movie's "poster" button. The movies can be
    sorted by clicking the sort button in the upper right corner and selecting
    which an order to sort the movies by (the sorting is done by using two movie
    lists, whose ordering differs, and rendering them in two separate bootstrap
    containers). Clicking on "About Site" will replace the movie-tiles with this
    text. To bring back the movie-tiles, click on "Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers"
    in the navbar.
